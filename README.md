## Now with gulp!

> I just learned how to install and implement gulp into my web projects and [here's](http://lupdre.github.io/gulpapp/) my first site. This is just a template but I think I've got the hang of it.
> I'm expecting a lot of learning curves but so far so good. 
> Help me with constructive criticism and helpful hints and pro tips by commenting on the [repository](https://github.com/LupDre/gulpapp). Thanks!
